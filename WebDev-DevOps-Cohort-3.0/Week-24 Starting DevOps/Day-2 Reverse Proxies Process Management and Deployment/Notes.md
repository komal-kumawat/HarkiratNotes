# EC2(Elastic compute cloud)
**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is a cloud service by AWS that provides **virtual servers (instances)** to run applications on the internet.

👉 Simple definition:
**EC2 = Rent a computer (server) in the cloud.**

---

### Why is it called EC2?

* **E** → Elastic (you can scale up/down anytime)
* **C2** → Compute Cloud

### Why “Elastic”?

“Elastic” means you can:

- Increase CPU/RAM anytime

- Add more servers during high traffic

- Remove servers when traffic decreases

So you only pay for what you use 💰

It’s called **Elastic Compute Cloud** because it provides **scalable computing power in the cloud**.
