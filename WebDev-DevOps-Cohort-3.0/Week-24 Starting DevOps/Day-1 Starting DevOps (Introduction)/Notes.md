# 🚀 What is DevOps?

**DevOps = Development + Operations**

It is a practice where:

* **Developers (Dev)** write code
* **Operations (Ops)** deploy & maintain servers

Instead of working separately, they **work together** to deliver software faster and more reliably.

---

## 🧠 Why DevOps was needed?

Earlier:

1. Developers write code
2. They give it to Ops team
3. Ops deploy it
4. If something breaks → blame game starts

DevOps solves this by:

* Automating deployment
* Continuous testing
* Continuous monitoring
* Collaboration

Main stages:

1️⃣ Plan
2️⃣ Code
3️⃣ Build
4️⃣ Test
5️⃣ Deploy
6️⃣ Monitor

This loop runs continuously.

# 🔥 Real Example

You build a MERN app.

Without DevOps:

* You manually upload files to server
* Manually restart server

With DevOps:

* You push code to GitHub
* CI automatically tests it
* CD automatically deploys it
* Monitoring checks performance

Everything automated.

# 👨‍💻 What Does a DevOps Engineer Do?

* Manage cloud servers
* Automate deployments
* Set up CI/CD pipelines
* Monitor systems
* Handle scalability

They are bridge between Dev & Ops.

# 💰 Is DevOps a Good Career?

Yes, because:

* High demand
* Good salary
* Needed in almost every company
* AI cannot easily replace infrastructure automation roles
