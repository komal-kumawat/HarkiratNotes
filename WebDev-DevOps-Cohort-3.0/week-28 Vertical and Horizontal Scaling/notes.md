htop:- htop is a command-line utility used to monitor system resources and manage running processes in real time.(using it we can visualise which CPU core is doing which job)


- Javascript is a single threaded language 
- if a lot of processes are running then the cpu cores do context switching between processes

- a single nodejs process can capture or take 100% of 1 cpu 

- since js is a single threaded lang. i can run my code on one of my cores at a time  , cann't run (same code) on multiple cores .

- thread is something that runs on cpu cores.
##### Vertical Scaling:-  vertical scaling means increasing the size or capacity of the machine to support more loads.


###### Horizontal scaling:-
